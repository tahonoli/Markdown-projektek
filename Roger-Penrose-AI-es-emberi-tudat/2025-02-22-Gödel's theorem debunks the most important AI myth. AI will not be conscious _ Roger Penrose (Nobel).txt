the name is wrong it's not artificial  intelligence intelligence would involve  Consciousness from the girdle argument  you see this is the plot which I think  has got lost now a computer is a very  specific kind of mathematical structure  it means computational mathematics it's  a very limited part of  mathematics I don't think they will ever  become conscious by virtue of being  computers in our current sense of the  word  but I think Consciousness it's not  computational that's still true with AI  you talk to an AI thing it doesn't know  what it's toing computers have got so  powerful that they've lost the thread of  what they're  doing I think the point has got  lost I think touring wasn't too far off  I I think people have lost the  plot few times you talk about the Nobel  Prize um we' back from Stockholm uh this  year we've been there  interviewing Nobel Prize winner don't  you think that this year Nobel Prize is  the tribute to the Nobel comedy for  artificial intelligence Nobel Prize  Nobel Prize and physx father for fathers  of of AI Nobel price in hemistry uh sir  Demis hassabis co-founder of deep mind  that's AI system David Baker computer  vision digitalization of proteins don't  you think there the tribute for AI I see  well you have to be careful first of all  the name is  wrong it's not artificial intelligence  it's not  intelligence intelligence would involve  Consciousness and I've always been a  strong promoter of the  idea that these devices is are not  conscious and they will not be be  conscious unless they bring in some  other ideas the comput they're not  they're all computable Notions but  intelligence it's not  Consciousness it depends on  Consciousness you see well it depends on  how you use the word I think when people  use the word intelligence they mean  something which is  conscious I mean that you see I  developed my own ideas after going to a  course course you see when I was a  graduate student in Cambridge I went to  three courses which were nothing to do  what I was supposed to be doing one was  by Bondi on general relativity one was  be dra on quantum mechanics the seem  wish very distinguished Paul D and the  third subject was on mathematical logic  and I learned about touring machines and  comput the notion of computability  and I know knew what computability meant  and I learned about girdle's theorem and  girdle's Theorem I found stunning  because it told you that there are  things that the  understanding transcends the use let me  put that more  clearly what girdle does it's very  clever what he does is to produce a  statement now suppose you you you're  trying to develop your mathematical  methods of proof what do you mean by  proving a theorem in mathematics how do  you know it's really true will you prove  it what does proof mean well you see  does it mean okay you've got a set of  rules and if you follow these rules that  makes it a proof now how do you know  these rules only give you truths well  you've looked at them carefully and you  say oh maybe AI create its own rules ah  no no you see have to be careful about  this this is the point but I I learned  from from Ste this is a man called Steen  who is a logician and I learned from him  this important thing about girdle's  theorem now girdle's theorem is  extremely clever you make a statement  which asserts that it's it cannot be  proved by these  rules it's just you the clever thing is  to make it do it it says you give your  rules which you regard as the rules of  proof proof and you could put them on a  computer so that mean they're  computational  rules now I knew that there were things  that you cannot put on a computer I  learned from this course that there are  non-computable things there are things  in mathematics which are not computable  now what does computable mean it means  that you can make a  computer well you have to Define what a  computer is and touring had one  definition of a computer there with  several other church and Curry other  people had their definitions of comput  they all turned out to be equivalent so  there is one universal notion of  computability which is what you mean by  what can be done by a computer maybe  this is only language problem that the  language development has not kept out  development of AI maybe we have just  only language problem that we cannot you  know describe what we create it no I  don't agree with that it's not a  language problem you see you make your  new language sure you can do that you  make your new language and that's what  you can do see let me describe the  girdle theorem how it works you see see  the girdle theorem says you construct a  statement which says you you see what it  means the way you've constructed the  sentence you can see what it means what  it means is I am not provable by those  rules  and it does that it really says that  then you see okay well is it perhaps it  is provable by the rules if it is  provable by the rules then it must be  true well I've said it the wrong way  around doesn't matter the other way  suppose it's false then that means it's  provable by the rules and if it's  provable by the rules you've understood  the rules you said you looked at them  all and say yes that's okay that's okay  that sure if you follow those rules it  is true so that means you believe  that the rules only give you truths so  therefore it is true that it's not  provable by the rules if it's false you  see then it is provable by the and  therefore it's true so it has to be true  and not provable by the rules I found  that amazing but still I don't  understand why AI cannot create its own  rules  because it doesn't know that they're  true you see that's the whole point  about the girdle theorem the whole point  as far as I'm concerned about the go  theorem is how do you transcend the  rules and that's what you do by  understanding them you understand them  why they're true it's not that you use  the rules but you understand why use of  the rules only gives you truths and  that's how you can prove things which go  beyond the rules by knowing why they're  true now knowing why they're true well  what does it mean what it means means  you understand them what does understand  mean you've got to be conscious of them  you see you the wording is clear it  means that you have to know what you're  doing you have to know why they're true  not that they're true you can be told  that they're true you can have you can  learn at school that they're true that's  not the point you have to know why  they're true why they're true needs  understanding them and understanding  them requires to being conscious of them  now that's require that you see the  point I was making is  that Consciousness enables you to  transcend the  rules you see why they're true and that  goes you beyond it you see what the  girdle theorum does it tells you how  to use your understanding of why the  rules are true to transcend the rules  you think that AI is the simple tool or  simple thing that we can use in the  single case no I don't say single it's  obviously infinite no clearly that's not  the  point the point is it doesn't know what  it's  doing that's still true with AI you talk  to an AI thing it doesn't know what it's  doing it has it speaks from experiences  if you like you see people have confused  the story the story is they've lost it  in the power of  computing the thing is that computers  have got so  powerful that they've lost lost the  thread of what they're doing they're  Computing do you regret it that it's so  power I well it's it's losing the  point you  see I think the point has got lost I  think touring wasn't too far off you see  he he was a little bit confused person  in way because he it was not clear what  he  believed but he did call this thing the  touring test how do you de decide  whether an entity is conscious or not  will you have a conversation with it you  talk to it maybe AI is a new sphere of  human existence no it's missing  something I think yeah that's the  trouble you see it's all I mean  obviously it has a role to play I'm not  going to say that clearly it has a role  to play it has a role but you must  mustn't be confused the fact that it has  a role to play it's to do with the power  of computation sure you computers have  got so powerful now that they can do  things Way Beyond what humans do in comp  Computing sure and you can take a mass  of data and you can analyze that data  and you can see what the data says and  does this thing in in accordance with  previous things in the data or is it not  and a that's all it does it doesn't  understand what it's  doing and and understanding is different  from Computing because inside a black  box there is just only statistic that's  this simple statistic  machine well if it's a machine it's not  conscious no I I think people have lost  the plot yes no that's true you see I  wrote my book The Emperor's New mind but  what does it mean that people lost the  plot yeah I think they've lost the plot  because  the whole point of my train of thought  was we've got to find something in  physics you see I believe I'm a  physicalist and that I believe whatever  is going on in our heads whatever  creates Consciousness is part of the  physical world I don't believe it magic  comes in from who knows what black boxs  it's also part of the physical rule but  what you mean by Black Box we know  what's at the input we know what's at  the output but we have no idea what's  deep inside that's the Black Box yes but  that's doesn't help because you don't  know what's inside what kind of physics  is inside that box maybe new physics yes  but new physics of a particular kind  what I'm claiming from the girdle  argument you see this is the plot which  I think has got lost what I claim is  saying that the physics that in is  involved in conscious thinking has to be  non-computable physics now the physics  we  know there's a little bit of a glitch  here because it's not completely clear  but as far as we can see the physics we  know is  computable you see uh what about general  relativity where we have wonderful  machines which compete what black holes  do when they spiral around each other  and produce gravitational wave signals  and you could say yeah yeah yeah that is  a black hole Collision because this has  this very clear feature yeah you can do  all that that is fine but that's not  what I'm talking about what I'm talking  about is the physics has to be a physics  which is in principle  non-computable so AI can blast his go  ahead as much as it likes it's not going  to be able to get this you talk about a  black box but you don't know what's in  that box is it a  computer is it a computer of the kind we  understand now is it something which  involves a physics which involves a  non-computable process not so far I'm  not saying that won't happen I dread it  because I don't want it to happen I  can't help it because I suspect it will  happen someday but it's not AI as we now  know it AI we as we now know it is  computer-driven  and that means it's not going  superhumans AI will never exist  what you trouble is that AI is a bad  term it means artificial  intelligence now intelligence in my view  is conscious that's what intelligence is  about okay so how I can call it  artificial um cleverness how about that  AC you can see the difference to some  extent when you do mathematical you have  mathematics students some of them  understand what they're doing some are  just clever they can they can repeat  what they've learned they know how to do  it very cleverly they can calculate very  well but they don't necessarily  understand what they're doing the the  physics we don't  know involves non-comp  computability so that's my claim so I  made this claim in the emperor's new  mind and I made it more a little bit  more forcefully in Shadows of the mind I  mean that maybe it's not the  consciousness maybe it's something  absolutely new maybe it's not a wordness  but that's there may be completely  unknowns which we have no concept of at  the moment that could be true I'm  talking about  things you see if you're talking about  AI that means unfortunately it's a bad  term because it says artificial  intelligence which to me what people use  that term they mean things that can be  done by by  computers that's what they  mean they have computers and their  computers are very powerful and then  what they mean by AI is using computers  it may not be using the Straight logical  way usually as I haven't studied these  things so I'm probably out of date but  but as far as I can see what it is is  you look at masses of data and then you  s look for patterns or you you try to  analyze it in that kind of way but it's  all computational you're using  computers but it's very nature it's  computational the word means  computational means by a computer now a  computer is a very specific kind of  mathematical structure it means  computational mathematics if you study  the mathematics as an abstract subject  you rapidly learn that there are things  Way Way Beyond  computability it's a very limited part  of mathematics some of the mathematics  is involved is not computable you can't  get at it by an algorithm now you see  people often think well AI doesn't use  algorithms because it's using sort of  random methods or something I don't know  I haven't studied in detail what AI  really Asser what is called AI really  involves when you put it on a computer  but it is being done by my computer so  it's still something computational no  question about that I'm claiming that  you want something non-computational now  you see people tend not to believe this  because they just think of computers and  they don't know there are non-computable  things if you study the mathematics  mathematical logic you see that there  are non-computable structures there are  could the logic the physics of the world  could easily be  non-computable and my view is that yes  it is non-computable  and that somehow Nature has been clever  enough to produce beings which can tap  into the non-computable aspect of the  physics and they managed to do this  using natural  selection I have no idea how far down  the animal kingdom and goes humans are  certainly conscious I believe anybody  who owns a dog is absolutely convinced  that dogs are conscious I believe it  cats probably elephants certainly  way down way way down probably octopus  is I'm  sure I don't know is a bacteria I'm  conscious I no idea is a is a a frog  conscious probably yes is a uh an amoeba  conscious I have no  idea I'm just speculating I've no real  reason for leaving these things but I  think  Consciousness is something  different it's not computational  and the thing is that it's just people  are so hypnotized I don't should use a  rude word like that really by the fact  that computers have got so powerful that  yeah there's the answer the computers  are so powerful we found the answer it's  just computers I'm saying no it's not  the answer is something much more deeper  than that it's not it's not more  complicated than that it's deeper than  that it involves a kind of physics which  we don't probably know yet it's deeper  because it's based on the quantum  world it's is beyond the quantum role  you see the quantum World Is Still  computable what's not computable in far  as we know what we don't there's a basic  unknown in Quantum world the quantum  theory is fundamentally  incomplete I call it even wrong in a  certain sense  because it believes that Quant  superpositions persists at all levels  maybe when we ever create the universal  quantum computer we can create a  synthetic  Consciousness  maybe yeah no I have nothing nothing  against the department for that I don't  like  it now I have  nothing um theoretically against that do  you agree with thate Nobel Prize  committee uh when you look at the Noble  in physics for father sopi I I haven't  looked at the details of it what I don't  know what they say for  fundamental  uh work  under synthetic neutral networks for  Jeffrey Hinton is it  physic I'd be rather doubtful whether  it's really  physics I'm not sure you see Nobel  prizes you might question some of their  decisions  sometimes I would question a few of them  maybe I would question this one I'm not  sure you I haven't I haven't looked at  it carefully it depends exactly what  they  say you see it's a technological advance  I would say it's probably making use  of I is it a theoretical advance or is  it's I don't think so is it but I mean  the Nobel committee normally doesn't  give the prize for purely  theoretical I mean it doesn't it does  you have to have a a physical  application of it yes now here I'm not  quite  sure I I'd have to see what the wording  is in the Nobel Prize to say whether I'm  happy with it or not I don't know my  question to is about this self-driving  car they are processing the thousand  hundreds of data maybe there is the  Consciousness there is the one of the  way of AI development that we are using  something like a digital sensus  collecting the numbers of data about the  reality around I don't think they're  conscious in any  sense but they could drive better than  humans that's possible I don't know what  the comparison is now um they certainly  make stupid ACD for time from time but  so do humans so so I I I it may be that  they become more reliable than humans  and that may not be too far off for all  I know I have no complaint about that I  don't think that's any indication that  they have  Consciousness after all we have uh  devices which  already turn off the lights at certain  times and maybe they know better when  the lights when it's getting dark and so  on or how to how to how how to economize  on on the on the use of electricity and  things like that how do you look at the  AI development and what's your  prediction about the future of AI see I  don't really know what AI does these  days you see so you're asking me a  question outside my area of expertise I  would say an area of expertise has to do  with whether these  devices actually do what we do I don't  think they do because they're not  conscious I don't think they will ever  become conscious by virtue of being  computers in our current sense of the  word I don't know if that's an answer to  your  question um it doesn't mean that they  won't be better than us the biggest risk  of AI development is I think there is a  risk involved here part of the risk is  people thinking that they're  actually that there is a conscious  they're conscious yes there might be an  even more of a risk if they were  conscious you see it maybe one could  understand what's involved in  Consciousness and developed some kind of  device I'm not calling it computer  because it in my view it would not be a  computer it would be something else some  device which is conscious and since I  believe Consciousness is a physical  process I don't think we understand it I  think it involves the collapse of the  wave function  that's partly a negative conclusion from  I don't see it anywhere else  um but the collapse of the wave function  is very  mysterious and involves certain  retrocausal things which are a little  bit  puzzling I think the way that time works  is not so clear when you're talking  about but there are certain  things which are in contradiction you  almost say with ordinary causality  it's not so much that they are it's that  you have to have different concepts of  what you mean by  reality and there are two concepts which  I've tried to separate from each other  one is classical reality and the other  is quantum reality now classical reality  is the sort of thing we normally talk  about we can touch we understand using  our senses but the main difference I'm  saying is you can ask the system say if  I I take this glass and I can ask the  glass I can say hello glass what shape  are you and don't do it that way but I  say okay what shape is the glass and I  say oh it's got a round top it's more  less cylindrical the classical it's  classical reality yeah now Quantum  reality is more  like well Einstein had a nice Criterion  but he didn't call it quantum reality  I'm calling it quantum reality this was  how do you know that the wave function  is real is the wave function of a  particle real or not  and a good example of this is the spin  of a spin half  particle now the spin of a spin half  particle is a Quantum thing now can you  ask the system hello hello system which  way are you  spinning it doesn't it looks at you  blankly and says I don't answer  questions like that ask me a different  kind of question please the right thing  to do is you say Okay particle is your  spin in that particular direction you  see the spin has an axis the way that  spin works for a spin half particle it  has a particular axis that's how you  describe the quantum state of a spin  half particle it has one particular  direction and it spins about that  direction now Can you ascertain that  direction no you can't it's Quantum  reality you cannot ascertain Quantum  reality you can only confirm it so I  like to use those two words ascertain I  can Asain Ain the shape of this glass  that's classical reality I can only  confirm Quantum reality I can if I think  I know which direction it's spinning I  said yeah I've got my calculation done I  said you've done this blah blah yes it's  probably by now spinning that way I say  hello State I think you're spinning that  way have I got you have I got it right  and if I have got it right it says yes  with certainty so that was Einstein's  Criterion so if you can confirm with  certainty  that it's then this gives you an element  of reality he called it an element of  reality I'm calling it an element of  quantum reality classical reality is the  other kind you can conf you can  ascertain classical reality you can only  confirm Quantum reality and you need  those two ideas and you need to separate  them and Quantum reality behaves very  peculiarly it actually behaves retr  causally what you might think there are  these experiments with I think you talk  about the Nobel Prize the one before  that one to Zing Ear and people about  these I think epr type experiments I  can't quite remember what they got it  for but it's something like that you  have these effects which seem to affect  the instantaneous you see you share a a  spin between Alice and Bob and Alice and  Bob originally have a spin zero and  their spins are opposite so if Alice's  spin is this way Bob's is this  way now suppose Alice measures her Spin  and she finds it to be that  way retr  causally along the past like cone so  it's not just simultaneous worse than  that it's into the past but not faster  than the light could go from this one to  this one so strange way around but retr  causally it becomes the opposite of  Alice's measurement Bob can't ascertain  it so he can't she can't send a signal  faster than light because he can only  confirm it he doesn't know which way it  is so you need that idea to make sense  of these epr Einstein pki Rosen type  experiments which I think would I'd have  to check exactly what the Nobel Prize  was the year before this one but I think  it was to do with that that's a very  important and fascinating Discovery but  to to understand what's going on I think  the best way to do it is using Quantum  reality and you you certainly can't send  a signal faster than light by these  means but you can  retrocausal backwards faster than light  or not as fast almost as fast as light  backwards if it's only Quantum reality  as long as we don't understand how  Quantum world work we cannot replace it  into I think it's not as bad as that you  see don't understand is  saying rather trying to put it into a  classical  perspective we can understand the  mathematics of it and we can get used to  it okay and that is involving an  understanding if somebody asks somebody  ask me a question I may not understand  it that well but I could do my best and  I might understand the quantum mechanics  well enough to give the answer that  quantum mechanics would say now that  means understanding sure it's an  understanding of what's going on you  there's this famous comment was it  nobody understands quantum mechanics was  that I I know  I I think I think it was bore yes no you  see I think that's  misleading you  see  understanding doesn't require it to be a  classical understanding we are  determined by the nature to understand  the classical world Quantum world is  indeterministic and it's  ununderstandable for our our mind a  little bit you need to use the formulas  to try to understand the quantum world I  think it's it's unfortunate to use the  word understanding in limited you can  say I don't know what word to use but  if understanding in the in the sort of  classical sense and that sure that fails  yes that does fail but it's not lack of  understanding you get the picture and  you can see oh yes I know how to make  the predictions in quantum mechanics  work and they can be quite yes no  predictions some of these predictions  don't have to be just probabilities so I  think the view is it gets sort of mixed  up with the idea oh you only know the  probabilities or something I think  that's  misleading these things are puzzling not  just because they're probabilistic they  are sometimes just probabilistic but  that's what makes them consistent by  having them only probabilistic but the  things which I find Most Fascinating  about quantum mechanics are not  probabilistic things they're like these  epr  effects sure it's probabilistic if you  ask somebody to to make a measurement  and it's only a Quantum reality that I  mean he's trying to make a classical  reality measurement he's only going to  get a probability as  answer I just think one has to separate  the  quantum reality from the classical  reality and and realize that the quantum  reality behaves differently yeah F but  it doesn't mean it's beyond  understanding I don't know if that's the  way people use the word understanding  often in that that way I think that's a  bit a bit misleading thank you very much  for your time right okay my pleasure no  it's been good fun thank you
